     <h1>Autumn Poem</h1>
     <p>The trees are kind of pretty <br>in their autumn gold and brown.
     <hr>Leaves are bright,orange and reddish <br> but all will soon fall down.
<hr>Then they dry and crackle <br>as we crunch them with our shoes.
<hr>I guess its time for Autumn now <br>as summer takes a snooze.</p>
